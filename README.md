# CS492-Team-Pandemic
This is a team based project where we will develop models and an interactive web interface similar to https://covidactnow.org/ which allows users to choose from multiple parameters in calculating the models. The models will be based on publicly available data from multiple sources, which we will retrieve by web-scraping, and APIs, import this data to a database, calculate statistical models, and display the data and models in a tabular format and clickable, map-based format.

#Usage

This project is still in development and will enventually be hosted with Github Pages. Until then, there is a version available at http://mcnall.dyndns.org:3000/. Due to the nature of development, there may be periods of time where the site is down for maintenance/debugging.
