# CS492-Team-Pandemic
This is a team based project where we will develop models and an interactive web interface similar to https://covidactnow.org/ which allows users to choose from multiple parameters in calculating the models. The models will be based on publicly available data from multiple sources, which we will retrieve by web-scraping, and APIs, import this data to a database, calculate statistical models, and display the data and models in a tabular format and clickable, map-based format.
